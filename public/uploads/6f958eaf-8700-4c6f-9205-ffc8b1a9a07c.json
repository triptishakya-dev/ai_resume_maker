          "explanation": "The 'Bachelor of Arts' degree without an explicit technical focus (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, or a minor) is a significant red flag for a 'Software Developer' role. This could lead to immediate disqualification by some recruiters or ATS filters. You must clearly explain how you acquired your robust technical skills (e.g., self-taught, bootcamps, online courses) and perhaps add relevant coursework or achievements under your education or a new 'Self-Taught / Bootcamp' section to bridge this gap."

          "explanation": "While many project bullets mention 'optimized,' 'reduced generation time,' or 'improved content accuracy,' adding specific metrics would significantly strengthen your claims. For example, instead of 'optimized API workflows to reduce generation time,' state 'optimized API workflows, reducing generation time by X%.' This adds concrete evidence of impact."

          "explanation": "The summary claims '2+ years of hands-on experience,' which the projects attempt to demonstrate. However, without a dedicated 'Work Experience' section showing professional employment, or clearer indication of when these projects were completed relative to your graduation, this claim might be viewed with skepticism, especially given the BA degree. Consider creating an 'Experience' section where you can list these projects with more context, possibly denoting them as 'Independent Projects' or 'Personal Ventures' and providing a timeframe if they represent dedicated periods of development equivalent to professional work."
