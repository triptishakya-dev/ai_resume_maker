        {
          "type": "good",
          "tip": "Clear Headings and Standard Sections",
          "explanation": "The resume uses standard headings like 'Summary', 'Education', 'Technical Skills', 'Projects', and 'Extracurricular Activities', which are easily parsable by ATS. The categorization within 'Technical Skills' is also excellent for ATS keyword matching."
        },
        {
          "type": "good",
          "tip": "Strong Keyword Density",
          "explanation": "The resume is rich with relevant keywords (e.g., React.js, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, APIs, LLMs, AI, RAG) that align perfectly with a modern 'software developer' role. These keywords are naturally integrated into the summary, skills, and project descriptions, which boosts ATS ranking."

        {
          "type": "improve",
          "tip": "Tailor to Specific Job Description",
          "explanation": "While the resume is strong generally, for optimal ATS performance, always tailor your 'Summary' and the descriptions within your 'Projects' to explicitly match keywords and phrases from the target job description. Even with a generic JD, researching common requirements for 'software developer' roles at the specific company can help fine-tune keyword usage."
        },
        {
          "type": "improve",
          "tip": "Quantify Impact More Explicitly",
          "explanation": "While some quantifiable achievements are present, ensure that every bullet point, especially in projects, clearly articulates the impact and results using numbers, percentages, or measurable outcomes. For instance, 'Optimized inference workflow for fast, accurate, and scalable resume analysis' could become 'Optimized inference workflow, reducing processing time by X% and improving accuracy by Y%.' This helps ATS identify high-impact contributions."

          "type": "good",
          "tip": "Concise and Impactful Language",
          "explanation": "The language is concise and avoids jargon where possible, focusing on impact. Bullet points are well-crafted to highlight achievements rather than just responsibilities."

        {
          "type": "improve",
          "tip": "Refine Summary for Brevity",
          "explanation": "The 'Summary' is strong but slightly long. Consider condensing it to 3-4 impactful lines to make it even more digestible for recruiters who scan resumes quickly. Ensure every word adds significant value."
        },
        {
          "type": "improve",
          "tip": "Consistency in Punctuation",
          "explanation": "Most bullet points end without punctuation, which is a common and acceptable style. However, ensure this is consistent throughout the entire resume. For example, some 'good' tips in the 'good' section don't have periods but the 'improve' tips do. Maintaining a uniform style enhances professionalism."

          "type": "good",

          "type": "improve",
          "tip": "Enhance Quantifiable Achievements",
          "explanation": "While good attempts at quantification are present, strive to add more specific metrics and results across all projects. For example, 'Optimized API workflows to reduce generation time and improve content accuracy' could specify *how much* time was reduced or *by what percentage* accuracy improved. 'Built a secure, high-availability donation system' could mention the volume of transactions processed or the user base served."

          "type": "improve",
          "tip": "Contextualize Education",
          "explanation": "The 'Education' section is minimal. For a Bachelor of Arts, it might be beneficial to briefly mention any relevant coursework, honors, or projects if applicable, especially if it relates to problem-solving, logic, or other transferable skills for software development. This helps bridge any perceived gap from a non-CS degree."

          "type": "good",

          "type": "improve",
          "tip": "Consider a More Conventional Font",
          "explanation": "While the current font is legible, some highly stylized fonts can occasionally cause issues with older ATS systems or simply be less universally appealing. Opting for a more standard, professional sans-serif font (e.g., Calibri, Arial, Lato, Montserrat) can ensure maximum compatibility and readability."

          "tip": "Consistent Link Presentation",
          "explanation": "For the 'Source Code' and 'Live Demo' links, ensure consistent styling. Currently, 'Source Code' is often followed by a dash and then 'Live Demo'. If both are always present, consider a consistent separator or placing them directly adjacent. Also, ensure the hyperlinks are correctly embedded and functional for all projects."
